Overview of the project:

Project: Student Grade Tracker

Objective: The Student Grade Tracker is a Python program designed to help educators, students, and parents manage and track academic performance. The program allows users to input grades for various subjects or assignments, calculates the average grade, and provides additional information such as the overall letter grade and GPA. This tool aims to simplify grade management and provide clear insights into academic performance.



Features: 
Grade Input: Enter grades for different subjects or assignments interactively.
Average Calculation: Automatically computes the average grade from the entered data. 
Letter Grade: Converts the average grade into a standard letter grade (A, B, C, D, F).
GPA Calculation: (Optional) Computes the GPA based on the grades, if required.
Tabular Display: Presents the grades, average, and letter grade in a neatly formatted table.
Error Handling: Includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs.


Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used to develop the grade tracker. 
pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis, used to handle and process grade data.
tabulate: A library for pretty-printing tables, used to display the results in a readable format.


Key Insights: 
Efficient Grade Management: This tool streamlines the process of tracking and managing student grades, making it easier to calculate and interpret academic performance.
Clear Visualization: Provides a tabular representation of grades and performance metrics, enhancing clarity and usability. Educational Utility: Useful for educators, students, and parents to monitor academic progress and make data-driven decisions. Error Handling: Includes basic validation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the input data.


Requirements: 
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
tabulate: For pretty-printing tables.
